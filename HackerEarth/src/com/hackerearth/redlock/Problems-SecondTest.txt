Problem 1
======================================================================
You are given a matrix A of size  (having N rows and M columns).c
 is the element of the matrix at  row and  column.
You have to perform Q queries. In each query, you are given 2 integers L and R, for which you have to count total number of such rows and columns which have their sum in the range L to R (both inclusive).

Input format

The first line of input contains a single integer N denoting the number of rows in matrix A.
This is followed by another line containing a single integer M denoting the number of columns in matrix A.
The next N lines describe the matrix A, each containing M space separated integers.
The next line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Then comes another line containing a single integer S which will always have a value 2.
The following Q lines describe the queries, each containing 2 space separated integers L and R as described in the problem statement.
OUTPUT FORMAT
The output should contain Q space separated integers,  integer of which denotes the answer to the query.
Problem 2
======================================================================
You are given an array a comprising  integers. You have to calculate the magic value of the array . Magic value of an array is equal to the difference between the sum of good integers in an array and the sum of the bad integers in an array.

Good integers are the ones whose indexes are not changed in an array when sorted , rest are bad.

Input format
First line of input contain a single integer .
Second line of input contain  space separated integers, elements of array .

Output format

Output a single integer, magic value of array .
