Each and Every Problem here comes from One or More Lectures of this playlist.

1. **Dynamically resizable Arrays** :- 
     * Reallocate and Copy (java default Implementation) 
     * Maintain multiple partitions of array and abstract it to a single object.
2. **Stack** :- Array Backed Stack Implementation for Learning purpose.
3. **Queue** :- Array Backed Queue Implementation for Learning purpose.
4. **Deque** :- Array Backed Deque data structure
5. **LinkedList** :- A basic LinkedList Implementation in java.
6. **DoublyLinkedList** :- add delete search get reverseTraversal
7. **CircularLinkedList** :- add delete and run Circularly
8. **CircularQueue** :- add delete run circularly
9. **InsertionSort on LinkedList** :- Insert in a linked List
10. **Heap (Max and Min Heap both)** :- Create Heap and search
11. **BinarySearchTree** :-	BinarySearchTree with TDD 
12. **HashMap** :- Basic implementation using generics (No focus on performance only focus was functionality) 
13. **Adjecency List** :- Implemenatation with fresh linkedlist.
14. **Conversion** :- Adjecency matrix to Adjecency List Conversion with a fresh linkedlist.
15. **Breadth First Search** : Implemented with Adjecency list and LinkedList and LinkedList Based Queue.(eventually due to a confusion I also implemented stack.:smile:)
16. **Depth First Search** : Implemented Final Adjecency list api for future use with a LinkedList and Stack,Queue. 
			Completed a graph traversal of depth first search.
